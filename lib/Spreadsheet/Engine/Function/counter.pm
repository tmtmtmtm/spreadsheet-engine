=head1 NAME

Spreadsheet::Engine::Function::counter - base class for counting functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use base 'Spreadsheet::Engine::Function::count';

  sub calculate { 
    return sub { 
      my $type = shift;
      return is_match($type)
    };
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides a base class for spreadsheet functions that count the
number of values in a list that match a certain type (COUNT, COUNTA,
COUNTBLANK, etc). 

=head1 METHODS 

=head2 argument_count

By default all such functions take one or more argument.

=head2 result_type

This is always a number.

=head1 TO SUBCLASS

=head2 calculate

Returns a subref that is given each type in turn and returns a
true/false value for whether or not it should be counted in the
total.
